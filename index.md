Hello!

I am a predoctoral researcher at Argonne National Labortory currently working on developing Reinforcement Learning based Optimization algorithms at the [Multi-physics commputation group](https://www.anl.gov/es/multiphysics-computation) in the Energy Systems division. 

I received my master's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington (UW) and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Mahindra Ecole Cetrale (MEC).

For datasets or codes used in my work, my resume or other inquiries, please contact me through this email: ksahil(at)uw(dot)edu. 

# News

[Nov 2021] I joined Argonne National Laboratory as a Predoctoral Researcher in Machine Learning.

[Jun 2021] I defended my MS thesis on ["Machine Learning for Coherent Structure Identification and Super Resolution of Turbulent flows".](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4_qIGupWNuO1_0t5gxtnd7SPjFznG6L/view?usp=sharing) and graduated from the University of Washington. 

[May 2021] I joined Telepath AI as a Data Science Research Fellow. 

[Dec 2020] I received the [Herbold Data Science Fellowhip](https://www.williamslaboratory.com/news/sahil-kommalapati-wins-herbold-data-science-fellowship).

[Nov 2020] I presented my research on turbulent coherent structure identification at APS-DFD 2020. 

[Dec 2019] I joined [Williams Turbulence Laboratory](https://www.williamslaboratory.com/) as a graduate student researcher.

# Selected projects from my previous experiences:

1. [MS Thesis on "Machine Learning for Coherent Structure Identification and Super Resolution of Turbulent flows".](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4_qIGupWNuO1_0t5gxtnd7SPjFznG6L/view?usp=sharing)

2. Super-resolution of turbulent particle Image velocimetry datasets using Machine learning. [GitHub Link.](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/superResolution)

3. Using Bayesian Analysis to identify coherent structures in Turbulent boundary layer data. Here is a [presentation](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/OwenLabPPT_5_27.pptx).

4. Using Model Predictive Control to stabilize the wake of a Rotating Cylinder. We are using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (with control) to linearize the flow model.[Github Link ](https://github.com/WannaBePhysicists/DMDc)

5. My Bachelor's thesis on the stability and Control of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/Sahil_Kommalapati_SE422_Report(2).pdf)

6. My review of the Koopman Operator theory for systems in the continuous spectrum. [PDF](https://github.com/kommalapatisahil/kommalapatisahil.github.io/blob/master/files/ME599_Lusch2018_1926528(3).pdf)

# Other works online:

I truly believe that elegant and clear teaching is a skill that is fundamental to the overall learning process and I thoroughly enjoy it. It strengthens my authority and confidence over the specific material and it ultimately nurtures my abilities towards better scientific communication. So, in that spirit, I have picked up the habit of writing about things that I find exciting and impactful. Visit my Medium page on the left (or top, if you are on your phone) to check out some of my articles.


# A call for collaborations.

I believe that the following ideas would be quite challenging to pursue independently. Please reach out to me if you find them relevant to your interests so that we can join forces and work together!

1. Linearizing fluid flow models using Koopman eigenfunctions to control wake shedding around a cylinder. Skills: Deep Learning, Koopman Operator Theory, CFD, python, Matlab-MPC toolbox.

2. Using Cellular Automata and Google Colab notebooks to visualize flow scenarios and prepare engaging notes on introductory Fluid Mechanics. Skills: CUDA, PYTHON, FLUIDS 101.
